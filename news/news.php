<h3>2007</h3>

<p> 
<b>December 2007: Visit our photo gallery of SC'07</b> 
<br> 
This year's SuperComputing conference in Reno, Nevada has been very
successful. For the first year we have been sharing an exhibition
booth with several faculty at the CIS dept. and Dr. Gao's group at the
ECE dept. The University of Delaware had many interesting posters to
show and a screen with short presentations on our work. Many people
(incl. funding officers from many funding agencies) came by the booth
and were very impressed with our work. Visit <a
href="http://gcl.cis.udel.edu/gallery/07_SC/">our photo
gallery </a> of our booth at SC'07. See you all again at SC'08 in
Austin, TX.

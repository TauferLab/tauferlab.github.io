abstract="Performance evaluation is crucial to understanding the behavior of scientific workflows and efficiently utilizing resources on high-performance computing architectures. In this study, we target an emerging type of workflow, called in situ workflows. Through an analysis of the state-of-the-art research on in situ workflows, we model a theoretical framework that helps characterize such workflows. We further propose a lightweight metric for assessing resource usage efficiency of an in situ workflow execution. By applying this metric to a simple, yet representative, synthetic workflow, we explore two possible scenarios (Idle Simulation and Idle Analyzer) for the execution of real in situ workflows. Experimental results show that there is no substantial difference in the performance of both the in transit placement (analytics on dedicated nodes) and the helper-core configuration (analytics co-allocated with simulation) on our target system.",

abstract = {The function of a protein depends on its three-dimensional structure. Current approaches based on homology for predicting a given protein's function do not work well at scale. In this work, we propose a representation of proteins that explicitly encodes secondary and tertiary structure into fix-sized images. In addition, we present a neural network architecture that exploits our data representation to perform protein function prediction. We validate the effectiveness of our encoding method and the strength of our neural network architecture through a 5-fold cross validation over roughly 63 thousand images, achieving an accuracy of 80% across 8 distinct classes. Our novel approach of encoding and classifying proteins is suitable for real-time processing, leading to high-throughput analysis.},

abstract = {For job allocation decision, current batch schedulers have access to and use only information on the number of nodes and runtime because it is readily available at submission time from user job scripts. User-provided runtimes are typically inaccurate because users overestimate or lack understanding of job resource requirements. Beyond the number of nodes and runtime, other system resources, including IO and network, are not available but play a key role in system performance. There is the need for automatic, general, and scalable tools that provide accurate resource usage information to schedulers so that, by becoming resource-aware, they can better manage system resources.We tackle this need by presenting a tool for Predicting Runtime and IO using Neural Networks (PRIONN). PRIONN automates prediction of per-job runtime and IO resource usage, enabling IO-aware scheduling on HPC systems. The novelty of our tool is the input of whole job scripts into deep learning models that allows complete automation of runtime and IO resource predictions. We demonstrate the power of PRIONN with runtime and IO resource predictions applied to IO-aware scheduling for real HPC data. Specifically, we achieve over 75% mean and 98% median accuracy for runtime and IO predictions across 300,000 jobs from a real HPC machine. We combine our per-job runtime and IO predictions with queue and system simulations to predict future system IO usage accurately. We predict over 50% of IO bursts in advance on a real HPC system.},

abstract = {We present KeyBin2, a key-based clustering method that is able to learn from distributed data in parallel. KeyBin2 uses random projections and discrete optimizations to efficiently clustering very high dimensional data. Because it is based on keys computed independently per dimension and per data point, KeyBin2 scales linearly. We perform accuracy and scalability tests to evaluate our algorithm's performance using synthetic and real datasets. The experiments show that KeyBin2 outperforms other parallel clustering methods for problems with increased complexity. Finally, we present an application of KeyBin2 for in-situ clustering of protein folding trajectories.},
